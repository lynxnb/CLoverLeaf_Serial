# @brief Makefile for CloverLeaf
# @author Wayne Gaudin, Andy Herdman, Niccol√≤ Betto
# @details Agnostic, platform independent makefile for the Clover Leaf benchmark code.
#
# It is not meant to be smart as to only recompile what's necessary.
#
# There is no single way of turning OpenMP compilation on with all compilers.
# The major compilers have been added as a variable. By default make will use gcc.
# To select a OpenMP compiler option, do this in the shell before typing make:-
#
#  export COMPILER=gcc       		# to select the gcc flags
#  export COMPILER=clang       	# to select the clang flags
#  export COMPILER=taffo       	# to select the taffo flags
#
# or this works as well:-
#
#  make COMPILER=gcc
#  make COMPILER=clang
#  make COMPILER=taffo
#
# usage: make                     # Will make all binaries (clover_leaf, test)
#        make clean               # Will clean up the directory
#        make DEBUG=1             # Will select debug options. If a compiler is selected, it will use compiler specific debug options
# e.g. make COMPILER=gcc DEBUG=1 # will compile with the gcc compiler with gcc debug flags
